# ManfredSynth
Hosts the code of the initial task I got from Vienna Symphonic Library

The task is the following:
-----------------------------------
Create a Windows VST/VST3 plugin synthesizer with a custom GUI

Deadline:
September 21st.

Requirements:
- The synthesizer should be polyphonic
- The output of the synthesizer should have at least one effect available (chorus/reverb/etc)
- The project should use at least one third-party framework for signal processing
- GUI controls for any applicable parameters. Bonus points for custom widgets!

Hints & Tips:
- The JUCE framework is a great starting point, with tutorials available for how to setup your system for development and how to create plug-ins:

- The Synthesis ToolKit (STK) framework contains several useful classes that are easy to use for synthesizer development, such as modeled guitars, flutes etc, and would be a good fit for the 3rd party framework requirement:

Help:
- The VSL development team are more than happy to help you at at any time. Me, Konrad and Karel are ready to help you with anything. Iâ€™ll invite you to our Slack, where we have a specific channel for c++ learning.

- The Cpplang Slack is a great help for learning C++.  If you have any issues, posting something in #learn should get you help very quickly.
